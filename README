The Lope Programming Language

Requirements:

* SML/NJ - do not use 110.68 or 110.69, as ML-Lex invocation appears to be i
  broken (.67 and .70 both appear to work, however). 

Building:

Just run 'make' in the src/ directory.  This will execute all of the tests.

'make debug' will output additional debugging information at runtime.
